# README for South Atlantic Cyclone Energetics Project

## Overview
This project aims to determine energetic patterns of cyclones in the South Atlantic. It involves pre-processing cyclone track data from the SAt dataset and subsequent analysis to compute the energetics of these weather systems. The project is structured into several directories, each serving a specific purpose in the workflow.

## Directory Structure
- `natural_earth_continents`: Contains shapefiles for the continents used in filtering cyclone tracks.
- `src_pre_process_tracks`: Holds the scripts for pre-processing cyclone track data.
- `tracks_SAt`: Contains raw track data.
- `tracks_SAt_filtered`: Stores the filtered and processed track data ready for energetic analysis.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9 or higher.
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, geopandas, tqdm, and others as required by the scripts.
- Shapefiles in the `natural_earth_continents` directory for continent filtering.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please follow standard coding practices and document any changes or additions made.
