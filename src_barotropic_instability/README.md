# src_barotropic_instability

This directory contains scripts used in the analysis of barotropic and baroclinic instabilities affecting cyclone development in the South Atlantic. Each script serves a specific purpose within the broader project.

## Scripts

### 1. automate_composites.py
**Description**: Makes composites of potential vorticity, absolute vorticity, and Eady Growth Rate for the systems selected by `export_systems_to_be_analysed.py`.

### 2. plot_barotropic_instability.py
**Description**: Plots the composites generated by `automate_composites.py`, facilitating visual analysis of these meteorological parameters over selected cyclonic systems.

### 3. export_systems_to_be_analysed.py
**Description**: Handles the selection and export of data for specific cyclonic systems designated for further analysis, ensuring targeted studies on critical cases.

### 4. find_levels.py
**Description**: Identifies which vertical levels are most significant for observing barotropic and baroclinic instabilities, essential for understanding the vertical structure of cyclones.

### 5. find_periods.py
**Description**: Determines crucial periods for cyclone development by analyzing temporal patterns and events, aiding in the identification of critical phases in cyclone evolution.
