    Each cluster center array consists of 16 values. These values represent the average scaled measurements of the energy terms (Ck, Ca, Ke, Ge) across the lifecycle phases (incipient, intensification, mature, decay). The first 4 values correspond to Ck for each phase, followed by 4 values for Ca, Ke, and Ge respectively.
