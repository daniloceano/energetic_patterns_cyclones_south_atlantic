# This directory contains the core scripts for pre-processing the cyclone tracks:

## `select_tracks.py`
- **Purpose**: Filters the raw track data based on specific geographic criteria and time spent over the continent.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads track data from CSV files.
  - Merges multiple track datasets.
  - Filters tracks based on genesis within predefined regions.
  - Excludes systems spending significant time over the continent.

### `plot_tracks.py`
- **Purpose**:  Visualizes the tracks of cyclones on a map.
- **Note**: Please provide more details about `plot_tracks.py` for a complete description.

### Logging
- `log.select_tracks.txt`: Contains logs generated by `select_tracks.py`, useful for debugging and understanding the script's execution flow.

## Usage
1. **Preparation**: Place raw track data in the `tracks_SAt` directory.
2. **Run Pre-processing**: Execute `src_pre_process_tracks/select_tracks.py` to filter and prepare the track data. 
   - This generates a filtered dataset in `tracks_SAt_filtered`.
3. **Visualization** (Optional): Use `src_pre_process_tracks/plot_tracks.py` to visualize the tracks.
4. **Analysis**: Proceed with the analysis of cyclone energetics using the processed data in `tracks_SAt_filtered`.
